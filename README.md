# School-Passion-Project
A passion project for my honors language arts class

Made with LuaRT Windows Programing Framework

This is a program designed to track the ammount of hours you put into work either by timing it or mannually inserting your hours.
It will then analyze the data and determine goals based on the ammount of required time and it'll give the user advice
on how to avoid being manipulated from their employers and peer pressure. It'll do this by outlining what is happening
and by having a separate option to show you facts about crunch and overworking.
